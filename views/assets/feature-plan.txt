Home Page:
    'cloud tracks' title changes to a 'welcome' message if the user is logged in

    paste button places clipboard content into form box
    
    form box HTTPS directly into API through vue

    a preview box of the track (its title, background, length) pops up and then the user is expected to press the okay button
        this starts a countdown timer that, after 5 seconds, automatically presses the okay button and procedes

        Of course, the user may press the okay button at any time, even before the preview has loaded

        This preview will occur as:
            the title of above the pastebox changes to the playlist title
            the cloud logo changes to a thumbnail from the playlist
